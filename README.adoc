== Description

Webhook Signatures are a kind of authentication method which is adding a level of security.  It ensure the request has originated from the known source and has not been tampered with.

The sender of the request generates their own HMAC signature (typically stored in a header of the request).  This policy will validate that signature by generating our own HMAC signature, and then comparing them.  If the signatures are a match, then the request is successfully validated.

The "Signature" is based on the model that the sender must authenticate itself with a digital signature produced by a shared symmetric key (e.g., HMAC).  Also known as the shared "secret".


== Configuration

|===
|Property |Required |Description |Default |Example

.^|sourceSignatureHeader
^.^|X
|Specify the location to find the Signature (typically from a HTTP header, and in Base64) (Supports EL)
^.^| -
^.^| {#request.headers['X-HMAC-Signature'][0]}

.^|schemeType
^.^|X
|By default, this policy will validate the signature only against the HTTP body.  Set this boolean to 'true' to include additional headers (as well as the HTTP body) in the signature validation.
^.^| false
^.^| -

.^|headers [Array]
^.^|-
|If the signature has been generated with additional headers (e.g. a timestamp), you will need to include the names of those additional header(s).
^.^| false
^.^| -

.^|secret
^.^|X
|The secret key used to generate and verify the signature (Supports EL).
^.^| -
^.^| passphrase

.^|algorithms
^.^|-
|A list of supported HMAC digest algorithms.
^.^| -
^.^| -

== Http Status Code

|Code |Message

.^| ```401```
| In case of:

* Missing or signature

* Request does not contain headers part of the signature

* Enforce HTTP headers not part of the signature

== Errors

If you're looking to override the default response provided by the policy, you can do it
thanks to the response templates feature. These templates must be define at the API level (see `Response Templates`
from the `Proxy` menu).

Here are the error keys sent by this policy:
